# proton - Profunctor optics

An **extremely experimental** implementation of profunctor optics in Haskell. 
This mostly exists so I have a place to experiment with new ideas and new optics. Most things should work but I offer no performance guarantees.

Not intended for use in production (yet).

Includes:

* Lenses
* Prisms
* Folds
* Traversals
* Getters
* Reviews
* Setters
* Isos
* Algebraic lenses
* Coalgebraic prisms
* Achromatic lenses
* Grids
* Grates
* Glass
* Loops
* Feedbacks
* Kaleidoscopes

And always growing!
