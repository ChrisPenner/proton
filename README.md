# proton - Profunctor optics

An extremely experimental implementation of profunctor optics combinators. Mostly exists so I have a place to experiment with new ideas, but I like to think the result is pretty elegant.

Not intended for use in production (yet).

Includes:

* Lenses
* Prisms
* Folds
* Traversals
* Getters
* Reviews
* Setters
* Isos
* Algebraic lenses
* Coalgebraic prisms
* Achromatic lenses
* Grids
* Grates
* Glass
* Loops
* Feedbacks
* Kaleidoscopes

And still growing!
